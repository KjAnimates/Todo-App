# Console Todo App
A simple, convenient task app that is used **on the console!**

# How to use
After running the app, You may see text that says

"NEW TASK"

and a prompt that says

"Name:"

This means you have no tasks, and you have to create one.

After typing in the name for your task, press `Enter`. This will lead you to a new page. Your screen should look something like this:

```txt
 > 0. [ NEW ]
   1. My Task
```

Use the arrow keys to move the cursor up and down.

if you would like to remove a task, press enter on the task.

You should now see a screen like this:

```txt
 > Delete
   Edit
```

**NOTE**: the edit button does not work yet, but will work at a later date.

Press enter on one of the options.

You should now be back at the first screen.
